# Poker Game Project♠️
I constructed a game of Texas Hold'em using arrays, 2D arrays, loops, exception handling, and JUnit Testing. This project simulates the functionality of a poker game, including dealing hands, evaluating winning combinations, and managing player actions. It demonstrates the application of key programming concepts such as object-oriented design and test-driven development to ensure robust and error-free gameplay. The game logic was extensively tested using JUnit to validate hand evaluations and game outcomes.
